/*
Your friend is having a lot of difficulties with multiplication tables. He's having the most trouble with the multiples of 8 table, and asks you to send him the multiples of 8 table so that he can learn it more easily. To do this, you decide to write a program that prints the multiples of 8 table. Because you will use your code again in the future to print other multiplcation tables, you decide to use a loop and only one print statement.

Your program must use the following format to print the multiples of 8 table (be careful with spaces):

0x8 = 0
1x8 = 8
...
10x8 = 80

Warning: Your program will not be reusable in the near future if you don't use a loop. You must use a loop to print the multiplication table.

Note
You may submit as many solutions as you wish. Only your highest score will be kept.
