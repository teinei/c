00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,240
PROFESSOR: I'm going to show you how
to read multiple things from the input

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,150
using a for repetition loop.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,350
First, I'm going to need
a variable, howMany.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,606
Let's put 0 for the moment.

6
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:22,520
howMany is how many things, how many
items I want to read from the input.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,090
And I will need the sum,
because the thing I want to do

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,430
is, I want to add all
the things that were

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:34,640
read from the input and output
the sum of all the things read.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,770
Then I will need a third variable,
which is the number that was read.

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:48,170
And I'm going to show you how to
use a for loop, for repetition loop

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,830
to do multiple scanf to read what's
inside the terminal multiple times.

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:00,060
So here, before I start
the repetition loop,

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,920
I have to ask how many items
will be read from the input.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,240
So I ask this with a scanf.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,920
First, I can put a printf.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:26,720
And I can ask, how many
items do you want to add?

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,590
Let's say that.

19
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,570
Right.

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,370
So then I do the scanf
%d, and I read the value,

21
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,930
and I put the value in
the variable howMany.

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,020
So that would be ampersand howMany.

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,800
Right.

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,870
So now I know how many
times I want to repeat

25
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,600
another scanf that will read all of
the stuff I put in the input terminal.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,030
So I can use the for repetition loop.

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,270


28
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,950
And I will repeat, how many times?

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,500
Well, howMany, which is
the variable howMany.

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,110


31
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,920
What will I repeat in this loop?

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,200
Well, I will read all of
the values from the input.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,370
So that would be a
scanf, again, with a %d.

34
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,300
And I will put what I have read
in the variable numberRead.

35
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,970


36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,800
And this number that I've just
read, I will first printf it.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:56,640
I have read %d from the input
terminal, and then \n.

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,700
And the %d is the numberRead.

39
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,270


40
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:09,720
And then, what I want to do, is I want
to add all of the things that I've read

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,880
and to put the result in the sum.

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,080
So the sum will be--

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,050
well, the old sum.

44
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,580
For example here, at
the beginning, it's 0.

45
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,370
Then it will be the
new value of the sum.

46
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,350
And I will add to the sum the number
that I've just read from the input.

47
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:36,270
And then I will printf sum
equals %d, and new line.

48
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,190
And the %d is the value
of the variable sum.

49
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,170
All right.

50
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,390
Let's try to compile
and run this program.

51
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,190
So first, I have, "How many
items do you want to add?"

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,220
I want to add three items.

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,500
And I type Enter.

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,600
Then I go into the repetition loop.

55
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,790
And as you can see here,
the sum is equal to 0.

56
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,440
The numberRead, first, is
equal to 0, and i is 0.

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,570
It's the first time I repeat
the instructions in the loop.

58
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,620
So the first item I want to add is 10.

59
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,620
So I put 10 in the
terminal, and I put Enter.

60
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,790
And see that the instructions,
where the printf, then the new sum

61
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,680
calculation, and another printf.

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,330
And the output is, "I have read
10 from the input terminal,

63
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,250
and the sum equals 10."

64
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,380
And then we repeat the instructions,
and we go back to the scanf.

65
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,760
So the second item I want to add is 4.

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,280
So I put 4, and I type Enter.

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,010
And then in the output, "I have
read 4 from the input terminal,

68
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,170
and the sum equals 14."

69
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,160
Why?

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,920
Because the old sum was
10, and then we added

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,570
4 that was just read from the input.

72
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,900
So the sum equals 14 now.

73
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,070
And then we repeat a third time, because
how many items do we want to add?

74
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,790
Three.

75
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,600
So it is the third time
we do the for loop.

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,260
And here, I want to add 2.

77
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,510
And then I press Enter.

78
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,920
And in the output, I can see, "I
have read 2 from the input terminal,

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:38,310
and the sum equals 16," which is the old
sum value, 14, plus 2, which equals 16.

80
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,850
So now I want, really, you
to test it by yourself.

81
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,450
It's very important here that
you test this program yourself

82
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,210
and that you understand
what's happening here,

83
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,240
and that you understand
what we do, exactly,

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,910
when we repeat the instructions here.

85
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,760
You have to understand that we read
a number, and then with the number

86
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,070
that we've just read, we
add it to the sum variable.

87
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,750
But the sum variable is also used here.

88
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,010
So we have the old sum variable,
and we added the new read number.

89
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,030
And we really have to understand
what's happening here.

90
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,750
So please try it by yourself
with your own numbers

91
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,500
and try to understand
what's happening here.

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,700
For example, try to
understand this for loop.

93
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,590
And you can see here that I
changed with howMany variable, so

94
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,360
that we can repeat a
certain number of times that

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,160
will be defined with the value
that is read from the first scanf,

96
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,940
answering the questions, "How
many items do we want to add?"

97
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,650
And this is the answer
from the input terminal.

98
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,840
The user said how many times he
wants to repeat this for loop.

99
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,930
And within the repetition, then,
you have multiple instructions.

100
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,940
So let's try it by yourself.

101
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,030
And let's try it with
other values as the input.

102
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,170
Do it right now.

103
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,798
