00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,930
PROFESSOR: I'm going to show you how to
do a simple calculation using integers

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,970
with addition, substraction,
multiplication, and parentheses.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,200
We won't see the division for now
because it's a special case in C,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,430
and it has a special behavior.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,170
We'll see that after.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,050
So let's start with a simple
calculation with a printf.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,285
3 plus 2 equals--

9
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:36,730
then I will output the result
with percent d. And 3 minus 2

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:50,230
equals percent d, and 3 times 2
equals percent d and then backslash n.

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,060
And then after the quote, I
have to do my calculation.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,400
So the first percent d is to output
the calculation that is 3 plus 2.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,900
And then with a comma, I
do the second parameter.

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,590
That is 3 minus 2.

15
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:16,530
And then with a comma, the third
parameter is 3 multiplied by 2.

16
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,690
And then semi-colon at the end.

17
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,080
Let's compile and run the program.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,090
3 plus 2 equals 5, and 3 minus 2
equals 1, and 3 times 2 equals 6.

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,380
Great.

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:41,910
Let's try another example here with
3 plus 2 times 3 equals percent d.

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,490
And then I will use the parentheses.

22
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,260
So if I open a parenthesis
within the quote,

23
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,150
then the closing parenthesis is not
written automatically by the editor

24
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,775
because we are within the quotes.

25
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:59,640
And this is special
behavior of the editor.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:10,470
So 3 plus 2 within parentheses
times 3 equals percent d

27
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,520
and then backslash n to have a new line.

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,160
And then I have to do a
comma with a parenthesis.

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,010
So the first one is 3 plus 2 times 3.

30
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,700
And then I come out
with another parameter--

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,540
parenthesis.

32
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,600
As you can see here, when I typed
the opening parenthesis, then

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,720
the closing one is automatically
written by the editor

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,880
because we are outside of the quotes.

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,580
So be aware of that.

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,970
So within the parentheses,
we have 3 plus 2.

37
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,180
And we do times 3.

38
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,680
Right.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,240


40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,010
Let's try that.

41
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,370
Compile and run.

42
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:07,020
So 3 plus 2 times 3 equals 9, and 3 plus
2 times 3 equals 15 with the parentheses.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,240
So let me put some other examples
for you that I will copy paste,

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,000
and that you can test by yourself.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,940
So here, we have different
options with different types

46
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,690
of calculation with different
types of parentheses,

47
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,610
as you can see here,
while I compile and run.

48
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,270
And look at the examples,
output in the terminal.

49
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:39,960
So we have 2 times 8 minus 2
times 7 minus 4 equals minus 2.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,650
And then we have different outputs
depending where we put the parentheses.

51
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,600
So you can try by yourself.

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,250
And try to put different parentheses
or different calculation,

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,530
and try to have your outputs.

54
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,590
Don't forget that if you have multiple
percent d in the printf, for example,

55
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,870
here we have three of them, then
you have to have three parameters.

56
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,410
It needs three commas, first
one to separate with a quote,

57
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,790
second one to separate the
first parameter with the second,

58
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,019
and the third to separate
the second with third.

59
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,460
Do your own calculation right
now with this codecast.

60
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,242
Try it.

61
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:27,742
