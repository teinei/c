00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830


2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,210
PROFESSOR: Let's introduce
a new type of variable.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,270
This type is the character variable.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:16,059
So to declare a variable that is of
type character, I just type C-H-A-R.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,940
And then the name of the
variable, like letter.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:26,410
And that's how you declare
a character variable.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,650


8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,680
How do you assign this variable?

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,040
Well, let me show you.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,330
You always use the assignment operator
and then we use the simple quote.

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,300
So I typed the simple
quote, and as you can see,

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,110
the editor is giving me the
closing quote corresponding.

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:57,550
And between these simple quotes,
I can put a character, like a

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,250
for example.

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:12,760
So that's how you define, or
initialize, or assign a character value.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,730


17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:23,480
Now, how do you print in the
output, this type of variable?

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:33,500
Well, in the printf, I can say
the letter is and I use the format

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,040
percent c for character.

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,070
And then, as for integer,
I put the variable name.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,712
So for example here, letter.

22
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,690
Let's try it.

23
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,020
Let's compile and run the program.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,790
And the terminal, you see
the output, the letter is a.

25
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,450
So that's how you declare
a character variable.

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,440
And with simple quotes, how you
define or assign a correct value

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,240
to a character variable and
with the percent c

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,720
this is how you print this variable.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Let's try it by yourself and replace
it with the character of your choice.

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,030
