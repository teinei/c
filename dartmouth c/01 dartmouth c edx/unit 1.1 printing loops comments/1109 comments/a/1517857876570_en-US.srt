00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110


2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,350
Next, we'll learn how to
add comments to your code.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,440
Comments are there to help you
explain to yourself and others

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,990
how your code is working.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,520
Because often, it can happen
when you look at your own code

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,079
five weeks after you wrote it, you
can't really understand it anymore.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,700
So comments are very important to
help explain what your code does.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,910
Here again, we see the
program we wrote earlier,

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:31,980
which writes BlahBlehBlih three times to
the screen and then BlohBlue six times

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,790
on a new line.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,580
So we wanted to add some comments here.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,900
For example, right here, we would,
for example, type two forward slashes.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
That tells that a comment is coming.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,560
You can ignore this for
the compiler purposes.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,470
This is only for the reader.

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,276
So we might type something
like, "A for loop

17
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:57,025
that prints BlahBlehBlih three times."

18
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:00,120


19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,700
And you can see that
the editor automatically

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,270
chose a different color
for this text that I typed

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,220
right here, because it's a comment.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,450
And so that stands out in my editor.

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,610
Another comment I might want
to add is when the loop ends.

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,910
So you could type something
like "End of for loop."

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,610
Also that we want to start a new line.

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,380
So "start new line" might be another
thing you might want to type here.

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,530
And again, you can see the color of
this text is different in the editor

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,900
because it's a comment.

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,780
And then you might want to
add another comment here.

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,960
"For loop that prints
BlohBluh six times".

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,130
All of these are comments
started by two forward slashes.

32
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,100
And these are one line comments.

33
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,940
And they won't influence the
execution of the program at all.

34
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,400
So if I compile this now
and then run the code,

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,830
nothing has changed whatsoever.

36
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,610
What has changed, however, is
that I added comments to my code

37
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,762
so that I can later better
understand how my code operates.

38
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:06,262
