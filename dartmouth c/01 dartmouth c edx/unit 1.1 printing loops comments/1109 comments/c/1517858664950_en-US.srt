00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,172


2
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:02,130
PROFESSOR: Now that we
know how to add comments

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,160
to our code on individual
lines or at the end of a line,

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,030
we'll learn another way to
put comments in our code.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,410
This time, comments that
go over multiple lines.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,950
Here we have a simple
program that contains

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,880
a for loop that will repeat
what's inside it three times.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,750
Inside the for loop printing
BlahBlehBlihBlohBluh and a space

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,750
after the last one, and then
we're repeating that three times.

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,060
So we expect one line on which we see
BlahBlehBlihBlohBluh three times

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,560
separated by spaces.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,400
Let's quickly compile and
run this code, and indeed,

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,270
we see BlahBlehBlihBlohBluh repeated **
three times separated by spaces.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,730
Now let's go to edit,
and suppose we wanted

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,600
to explain what this program
actually does to someone.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,920
To do so over multiple lines, we
would start a multi-line comment

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,410
by typing forward slash and star.

18
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,800
The end of a multi-line
comment is indicated

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
with a star and a forward slash.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,890
So the same two symbols,
just in the opposite order.

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,900
Anything that goes in between
is considered a comment

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,940
and will be ignored by the compiler.

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,012
So for example, we might type
here, this program uses a for loop.

24
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:17,720
And suppose I wanted
to start a new line.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,780
I simply hit Return here, and the
comment continues on the next line.

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:31,230
So this program uses
for a loop to print out

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:39,400
a new line BlahBlehBlihBlohBluh three times.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,270


29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,420
And you can see the color of
my text has changed again,

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,190
indicating that this is a comment.

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:53,260
Anything between slash star and
star slash is considered a comment.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,950
So this won't affect the
execution of my program at all.

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,920
It's just there to explain
what my program does.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,050
Let's quickly make sure
this actually works.

35
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,360
Let's compile and run, and indeed the
program acts exactly as it did before.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,270
Let's go back to edit mode, and
let's see what else we can do.

37
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,010
Suppose you discovered that you actually
didn't want these first four printf

38
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,460
statements in this for loop, you just
want it to print Bluh three times.

39
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,100
Well I could put a slash star in
front of the first printf statement

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,850
and a star slash behind the
fourth printf statement,

41
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,650
and now anything between the
slash star and the star slash

42
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,900
is considered a comment.

43
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,570
So all of these printf statements
are actually now considered comments

44
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,760
and will be ignored by the compiler.

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
In other words, the only printf
statement that will be executed

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,950
is this very last one.

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,210
Let's give this a try.

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,400
Compile and run the code.

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,430
And indeed it only
prints Bluh three times,

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,610
because we said we would
repeat this loop three times.

51
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,600
Let's go back to editing.

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,100
And let's get rid of
these comment signs now so

53
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,720
that our code is back
to where it was before.

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,060
If we now compile and run,
the code acts exactly the way

55
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,550
it did before, and prints
BlahBlehBlihBlohBluh three times in a row.

56
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,060
Suppose now I want to just get rid of
the third and fourth printf statement.

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,240
Well I can do that by starting a comment
before the first printf statement

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,810
I want to get rid of, and ending
that comment after the second one.

59
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,330
So now these two lines of code all
of a sudden appear as comments.

60
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,440
And what's going to happen
is we're going to print Blah

61
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Bleh, we're going to skip Blih,
Bloh, and go right to Bluh.

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,320
So what do we expect the output to be?

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,770
We expect it to be BlahBlehBluh
space BlahBlehBluh space

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,810
BlahBlehBluh space,
because I'm simply missing

65
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,240
the Blih and the Bloh in the middle.

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,210
Let's compile the code and run.

67
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:03,660
And indeed BlahBlehBluh, BlahBlehBluh
BlahBlehBluh as we expected.

68
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,070
Let me go back to editing.

69
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,030
We can again remove these
commentary signs if we wish to.

70
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,760
And the code is back
to its original form.

71
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,130
So multi-line comment can be very useful
in quickly commenting out some code

72
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,274
that you just don't
want to currently use,

73
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,690
but you don't want to delete
the lines either, because you

74
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,120
might want to use the code again later.

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,660
Comments are very useful.
