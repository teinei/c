00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420


2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,480
PROFESSOR: I'm going to
show you how to comment some

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
of the lines that include code already.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,770
So we have two ways of doing that.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,670
First is to put the comment
at the end of the instruction.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,530
For example, here we have
a program with two loops,

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,850
then the first one is repeating
three times BlahBlehBlih

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,780
And then we have a new
line with a printf,

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,950
and the second one is repeating
six times, as you can see here,

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,530
BlohBluh So if I compile and
execute, then we have BlahBlehBlih

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,160
three times and BlohBluh six times.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,060
And to separate the
two, we have a new line.

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,580
All right, so let me
go back to Edit mode.

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,620
So I want to comment this code.

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,310
So what I can do is, at
the end of each code line,

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,990
I can put any comment I want to
make it clearer for someone

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,550
that will read the code.

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,315
So here, beginning of the main.

19
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,220
Well, this doesn't serve you.

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,400
You don't have to say that.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:24,765
This line, for example, I can say
specific line used to repeat with the for.

22
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:27,270


23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,490
This is the start of the
first loop, and this is

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,220
the first instruction inside the loop.

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,410
And this is the second
instruction inside the loop.

26
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,970
And this is the third
instruction inside the loop.

27
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,970


28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,760
And what is this one?

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,440
This is the end of the first loop.

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,660


31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,320
Well, that prints new line.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:19,970
And this is a second loop, so
the beginning of a second loop.

33
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:27,260
And this is the first
instruction of the second loop.

34
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,730
And this is the second
instruction with the second loop.

35
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,250
All right.

36
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,300
And this is the end of the second loop.

37
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,520
That's how you put some comment
at the end of the instruction.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,450
So these ones are very simple comments
just to show you how it works.

39
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,440
So it's just a double slash
at the end of the instruction,

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,750
so after the semicolon.

41
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,850
Or here, as you can see,
it's the beginning of a loop,

42
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,120
so I put it just after the opening
brace, or here, the same for the main

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,530
just after.

44
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,490
So at the end of the line, if you
finish the line with a double slash,

45
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,410
then the rest is a comment.

46
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,960
As you can see here
it's in different colors

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
to say that it's a comment.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,900
Something else that
I want to show you is

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,350
that you can comment very easily
one line so that it is not executed.

50
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,190
So by the way, here, if I
compile and run the program,

51
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,760
it is exactly the same
behavior and the same output

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,650
because it doesn't change
the behavior of the program.

53
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,220
But now I'm going to show
you how you can comment

54
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,810
one line to change the behavior.

55
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,860
For example, for the
first repetition loop,

56
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,330
I can comment the first printf by
putting two slash before the printf.

57
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,310
And as you can see, the printf changes
the color and is now a comment,

58
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,740
so it will not be executed anymore.

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,480
So if I compile and run, you
can see that instead of having

60
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,860
BlahBlehBlih, we have BlehBlih.

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,870
I can do the same with
Bleh, for example.

62
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,910
I compile and run, and
now for the first loop

63
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,790
we only have Blih Blih Blih
instead of

64
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,660
BlahBlehBlih because I just
commented the two first lines.

65
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,970
So you get the point.

66
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,310
Anytime you want to
do some testing, it's

67
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,470
very good to comment some of the lines
to see the behavior of the program.

68
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,790
So that's a good way to debug a program.

69
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,340
Here I just commented the
Bloh line in the second loop,

70
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,170
so I only have the Bluh.

71
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,760
And here I have only Blih
that is not commented and Bluh

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,440
that is not commented.

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,740
And that's a way to debug a program
so that you can comment and uncomment

74
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,640
some of the lines very easily and
see what's happening if you have

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,970
a certain bug to focus more on the bug.

76
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,870
So you can try by yourself
and comment some of the line,

77
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,690
but be careful, because if
you comment, for example,

78
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,820
the beginning of the
first loop, the for,

79
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,470
then you will have some
syntactic error because you

80
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,100
have the closing brace for the
for, but the opening brace for the

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,140
for is commented.

82
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,550
So that's a syntactic error.

83
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,970
So you have to make sure
that, if you comment a line,

84
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:34,590
you still keep a certain behavior
that is correct to debug your program.

85
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,950
So go ahead and try to
comment some of the lines here

86
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,830
or uncomment some of the
lines and see if you can

87
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,030
play with the comments within the code.

88
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,070
